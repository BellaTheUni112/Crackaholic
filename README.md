# Crackaholic
A simple DRM-bypasser.
Bases on Goldberg

Meant to bypass SteamDRM (Steamworks) to archive games by making them playable long after servers shut down.

This tool can only bypass SteamDRM (Steamworks)

This tool may get detected as malware, but this is a false positive.
I did not code this maliciously, it gets detected because the binaries have malware-like behaviour but are not malware.
