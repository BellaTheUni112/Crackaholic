# Crackaholic
A simple DRM-bypasser.
Based on Goldberg

Meant to bypass SteamDRM (Steamworks) and remove SteamStub to archive games by making them playable long after servers shut down.

This tool can bypass SteamDRM (Steamworks) and can remove SteamStub

Some games require steam.dll to be in it's directory, so I have provided it.
If a game requires it, just copy and paste it into the game's directory.

This tool may get detected as malware, but this is a false positive.
I did not code this maliciously, it gets detected because the binaries have malware-like behaviour but are not malware.
